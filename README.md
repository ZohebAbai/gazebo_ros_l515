*If you require gazebo implementation for other Intel Realsense cameras (ex: D435) please check the repositories mentioned in the acknowledgement section.*

## Install Dependencies
- [ROS](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) 
- [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install)
- [Gazebo-ROS](https://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros)

## Build the Package
If you already have a catkin workspace skip this step, else
```shell
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```
**Clone the repository and the build the package**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zohebabai/gazebo_ros_l515.git .
cd ..
catkin_make
cakin_make install
```

If not done already, Insert this in your `~/.bashrc` file for sourcing your workspace:
```shell
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## Launch the ROS-Package
```shell
